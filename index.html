				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch"> The Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a> , also known as the Pacific trash vortex, or the GPGP, is a collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_debris"> marine debris </a> in the North Pacific Ocean. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_debris"> Marine debris </a> is litter that ends up in large bodies of water. Unfortunately, there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_patch"> garbage patches of marine debris </a> , and the GPGP is only one of the five largest offshore plastic accumulation zones. The GPGP is so big it spans waters from the West Coast of North America to Japan.
