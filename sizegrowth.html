		<h1> What Is The GPGP Made Of And Why Is It Still Growing&quest; </h1>
		<div class="Info"> <h2> How Large Is The GPGP&quest; </h2>
			<p>
				The GPGP is estimated to cover 1.6 million square kilometers of the ocean&rsquo;s surface, or three times the size of France. The GPGP is made up of the Western Garbage Patch, located near Japan and the Eastern Garbage Patch, located between the U.S. states of Hawaii and California.  The Western Garbage Patch and the Eastern Garbage Patch are linked together by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre"> North Pacific Subtropical Zone </a> , which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Hawaii.  This zone is where warm water from the South Pacific mixes with the cooler water from the Arctic, and moves trash between the two patches at the same time. Nobody knows how much debris makes up the GPGP because not all of the trash floats on the surface.  Denser debris can sink meters below the surface, which makes the area&rsquo;s volume almost impossible to measure.

		<div class="Info"> <h2> What Does The GPGP Look Like&quest; </h2>
			<p> 
				What do you picture when you think of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch&quest; Many people think of an island of trash floating on the ocean...but that is not the most accurate&excl; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics"> Microplastics </a> can not always be seen by the naked eye, even satellite images do not always pick up the GPGP&rsquo;s microplastics, but rather a cloudy soup mixed with larger items that have not broken down or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"> biodegraded </a> .

		<div class="Info"> <h2> What Is The GPGP Made Of&quest; </h2>
			<p>
				The GPGP is growing because most of the marine debris is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic"> non&hyphen;biodegradable plastic </a>, meaning that instead of biodegrading, the sun breaks down the plastics into microplastics through a process called photodegradation.  But, no matter the consequences, plastics are still being used in consumer and industrial products, for its high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability"> durability </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility"> malleability </a> , especially relative to its cost.

			<p>
				Instead of biodegrading like other textiles do, many plastics go through a much longer process called &ldquo;Photodegradation&rdquo;.  When plastic is left in the sun its UV rays hit the plastic and change the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"> chemical compound </a>. The chemical compound changes in a way that makes the plastic more brittle, and so it begins breaking down. This rigorous process continues until the plastic is fully broken down into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics">&ldquo;microplastics&rdquo;</a> , which can take up to 1000 years.
