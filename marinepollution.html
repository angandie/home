		<div class="Info"> <p>
         Every year, an estimated 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans.  As discussed, most of these plastics will not biodegrade, but rather take hundreds, even thousands of years to break down through photodegradation.  While these percentages may vary by region, scientists estimate that 80&percnt; of plastic in the ocean comes from land&hyphen;based sources and the other 20&percnt; comes from marine sources.  Let&lsquo;s take a look at the toll marine pollution can take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology"> marine population </a> itself, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"> human population </a>.

			<ul>
				<li> Fish get tangled and disoriented within nets </li>
				<li> Animals mistake plastic bags and trash as food and eat it, which often leaves them with deficiency in nutrients </li>
				<li> Smaller organisms mistake microplastics as food, and the plastic toxins leach into their skin </li>
				<li> Sea turtles consume plastic straws thinking that it is food, though it only creates more empty space in the turtle&rsquo;s stomach </li>
				<li> Plastic waste kills up to a million seabirds every year </li>
			</ul>
